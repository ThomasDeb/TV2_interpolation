# TV<sup>(2)</sup> Interpolation
Matlab and Python implementation of a regression method for noisy 1D data that minimizes second-order total-variation (TV<sup>(2)</sup>) regularization with the minimum number of piecewise-linear regions.
It provides the sparsest solution (i.e., with the fewest breakpoints) to the following optimization problem:

$$ \underset{f}{\arg \min} \left( \frac12 \sum_{n=1}^N (f(x_n) - y_n)^2 + \lambda \Vert f'' \Vert_{\mathrm{TV}} \right), $$

where:
- $f$ is the (piecewise-linear) regression function
- $(x_n, y_n)$ with $1 \leq n \leq N$ are the $N$ data points
- $\lambda \geq 0$ is the regularization parameter, which should be adjusted according to the noise level. It controls the tradeoff between data fidelity and number of breakpoints ($\lambda \to 0$ leads to linear interpolation, $\lambda \to \infty$ to linear regression)
- $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{\mathrm{TV}}$ is the sparsity-promoting total-variation norm for measures

The Matlab implementation uses the [GlobalBioIm library](https://github.com/Biomedical-Imaging-Group/GlobalBioIm) as a dependency. The Python version uses a custom implementation of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm; its only dependencies are Numpy and Scipy.

## Getting started

**Matlab**:
- gBLASSO_sol.m solves the (g-BLASSO) regression problem for a fixed regularization parameter
- user_interface.m does so with a GUI that allows to user to vary the regularization parameter manually
- main_example.m gives an example of how these functions are applied

**Python**:
- `denoise_y()` in denoising.py computes the denoised data points (with adjustable noise level) using ADMM
- `sparsest_interpolant()` in sparsification.py computes the linear spline that connects the noisy data points with the fewest possible knots using Algorithm 1 in Debarre et al. 2022
- main_example.py gives an example of how these functions are applied
